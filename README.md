# 🧹 Housekeepr

[Deployment](https://housekeepr.vercel.app/)

**Housekeepr** is an employee management web app built using **React with TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase**. It’s designed to streamline communication between housekeeping teams — a follow-up to [Roomer v1](https://github.com/ammar-15/Roomer-demo).

## ✨ Why I Made It

After building [Roomer v1](https://github.com/ammar-15/Roomer-demo), I wanted to take things to the next level using **React** and **TypeScript**.

Housekeepr is built with better structure, component-based design, and a complete thought towards housekeeping teams to streamline operations. It's also mobile-friendly and has features that help manage teams and daily workflows effectively.

## 🔍 What the App Does

Housekeepr helps hotel teams:

- ✅ View, assign, and manage rooms for cleaning.
- 📋 Add internal notes per room to share special cleaning instructions or updates
- 🧠 Use **Smart Add** to automatically assign 100+ rooms across all available staff
- 📈 Track progress of each employee’s assigned tasks
- 👥 Support multiple users, where each staff member can mark their progress independently
- 📊 Monitor daily housekeeping statistics to understand team productivity
- ➕ Easily add, remove, or update room statuses with real-time syncing

## ⚙️ How the App Works

- Housekeeping manager can assign rooms for every housekeeping staff.
- Each Housekeeping staff sees their own dashboard with assigned rooms and can update their progress.
- Smart Add evenly distributes room workload across available users during the start of the day.
- Notes can be added per room to ensure special instructions are communicated.
- Progress stats give everyone a clear overview of the team's status.
- Everything syncs in real-time using Firebase Firestore.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **React (with TypeScript)** – Frontend framework for a structured, component-based design

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me grow a lot as a frontend developer. Some key concepts I learned and applied:

- Used **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) for state and lifecycle management  
- Integrated **Firebase Firestore** for real-time data updates  
- Built a **modular and responsive UI** using **TailwindCSS**  
- Applied **data filtering and mapping algorithms** for room assignments  
- Handled **routing, modals, dropdowns**, and dynamic UI interactions

## 🚀 Future Versions (Ideas/To-Do)

- Authentication and role-based access (Admin, Housekeeping, Front Desk)
- Notification system for task updates or room changes
- Employee performance analytics
